# Awesome Compose [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

![logo](awesome-compose.jpg)

> A curated list of Docker Compose samples.

These samples provide a starting point for how to integrate different services using a Compose file and to manage their deployment with Docker Compose.

> **Note**
> The following samples are intended for use in local development environments such as project setups, tinkering with software stacks, etc. These samples must not be deployed in production environments.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you through the bootstrap phase of creating and
deploying samples of containerized applications with Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- Make sure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
  - Windows or macOS:
    [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
  - Linux: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and then
    [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
- Download some or all of the samples from this repository.

### Docker Compose Format Specification
- Volumes
> [SOURCE:]TARGET[:MODE]


### Running a sample

The root directory of each sample contains the `compose.yaml` which
describes the configuration of service components. All samples can be run in
a local environment by going into the root directory of each one and executing:

```console
docker compose up -d
```

Check the `README.md` of each sample to get more details on the structure and
what is the expected output.
To stop and remove all containers of the sample application run:

```console
docker compose down
```

### Quickstart guides

In addition to all the ready to run Compose samples listed above the folder [official-documentation-samples](official-documentation-samples/README.md) contains quickstart guides. Each of these step by step guides explain which files need to be created to build and run a Docker Compose application.
